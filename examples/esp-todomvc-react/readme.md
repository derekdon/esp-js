# React TodoMVC Example with ESP Integration

This React example integrates ESP (Evented State Processing) for its model.

> ESP is a new architectural design pattern for managing the 'M' in your MVC application, based on reactive programming and domain driven design. The heart of ESP is a clear model that comprehensively captures your entire application's state, which is published to your controllers as single observable stream of changes. Inside the the model, ESP events and processors provide a scalable pattern for decomposing complicated interdependent logic into manageable chunks. It's great for big, complex applications with complex state transitions and real-time events (e.g. streaming data).

> React is a JavaScript library for creating user interfaces. Its core principles are declarative code, efficiency, and flexibility. Simply specify what your component looks like and React will keep it up-to-date when the underlying data changes.
