## Running

You must have [npm](https://www.npmjs.org/) installed on your computer.
From the same directory as this read me run these commands from the command line:

`npm install`

This will install all dependencies.

`npm start`

This will call babel to transpile app.js and run it via node.

There are several examples in the readme, you'll get an option to select which example to run.
